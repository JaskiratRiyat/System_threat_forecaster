System Threat Forecaster - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my solution to a Kaggle competition focused on building a Threat Forecasting System. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts potential threats based on historical data on malware detection.

🧠 Project Overview

- **Competition**: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/System-Threat-Forecaster
- **Objective**: Predict potential future threats based on various features in the dataset.
- **Approach**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction generation using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.


## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset includes:

- **train.csv**: Contains labeled data with features and the target variable (e.g.,machineID, product name, engine version etc.).
- **test.csv**: Unlabeled data for generating predictions for the competition.

> Note: These datasets are included here for reproducibility. Please refer to Kaggle's license and competition rules if you use or share this data elsewhere.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threat-forecasting-kaggle.git
   cd threat-forecasting-kaggle
2. Then select the .pynb file and access it in google collab or kaggle
3. Ensure to also upload the train and test csv


📊 Model & Evaluation
Preprocessing steps like handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling were applied.

Model(s) used: (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, XGBoost, LightGBM)

Evaluation Metric: (e.g., F1 Score, Accuracy, Log Loss, etc.)

📈 Results
Achieved 0.62920 score

Predictions were generated for the test set and saved for submission.
